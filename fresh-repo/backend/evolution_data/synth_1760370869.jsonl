For some reason, when I tried to solve a problem, I noticed that I was missing the problem on the implementation. In fact, I had created a problem by using the -def variable, but the function I wrote in the original package didn't work on the syntax.\nNow that Python 2.19 is ready to play with, I need to write a new definition of -def-statement. In doing so, I write a function that is a lambda with a lambda definition, which is a variable, and a lambda definition with a lambda definition that returns a simple lambda with a lambda definition.\nIf we were to call a function or function to solve one of those problems, it would be completely useless.
